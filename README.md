# Coding-Practice-Python
This repository contains some of the problems I've solved from Leetcode to get better at algorithms/data structures.

This is a round of practicing exercises I completed recently. Most of the problems have comments and time and space complexity defined as I think it should be. Please be aware that the problems are definitely prone to improvement and can be solved with more efficient algorithms. I've been learning on my own about CS so I might skip more clever techniques for problem solution.

Any feedback is highly appreciated :)
